# PIG-Game

The **PIG Dice Game** is a classic dice game where players take turns rolling a six-sided die. The goal is to accumulate points by rolling the die as many times as desired during a turn. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during that turn. The first player to reach or exceed 50 points wins!

## **How to Play**

1. **Number of Players**: The game supports 2 to 4 players.
2. **Rolling the Dice**: On your turn, choose whether to roll the dice or hold your current score.
   - If you roll a number between 2-6, it gets added to your turn’s total score.
   - If you roll a 1, your turn ends, and you score zero points for that turn.
   - You can hold your score at any time, adding the turn’s score to your overall score and passing the turn to the next player.
3. **Winning the Game**: The first player to reach or exceed 50 points wins.

## **Features**

- **Support for Multiple Players**: Play with 2 to 4 players.
- **Simple Controls**: Easily roll the dice or hold your score with simple inputs.
- **Quit Anytime**: Quit the game anytime by entering 'Q'.
